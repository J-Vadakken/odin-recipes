# odin-recipes

The goal is to create an html webpage that links to various other pages.

The webpage contains a list of some recipes I know, and each link takes you to a more detailed description.

The goal of this project is just to get used to using some html elements as part of the Odin Project.

The published site can be found at https://j-vadakken.github.io/odin-recipes/
